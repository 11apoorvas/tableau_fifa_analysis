FIFA is one of the most popular football video games . It simulates real-life football matches and allows players to control football teams composed of real-life players. Each player in the game has attributes that affect their performance , such as speed, shooting accuracy, and defensive skills. These attributes are quantified in a dataset, which provides information that is analyzed to gain insights into player and team performance.
